# Welcome!

## About
I'm Thomas Moreno Cooper (Tommy), a Franco-British 21 year old final year computer science masters student at the University of Leeds, specialising in high performance graphics and games engineering.

From the moment I owned my first console as a child in 2005 (a wonderful blue Nintendo DS), computer games have never left my side and I've been fortunate enough to have played a wide variety of games. 

Prior to my studies at Leeds, my experience in computer science amounted to writing algorithms on a programable calculator; my speciality at high school was mathematics. Coming to the UK after living in France all my life to study a completely new subject was daunting, and I have no shame in saying I struggled in my first two years. 
Gradually, however, I got better at the subject and have now reached the point where I am confident in my work and enjoy programming, specifically graphics and physics simulations.

## Portfolio
Please find here the links to relevant projects I have been involved in over the years. Most of these will be academic projects, as my course was extremely coursework intensive and implement techniques and concepts that are found in games applications.
