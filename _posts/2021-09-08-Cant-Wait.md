[Can't wait][game] is a physics based game made with the Unity game engine where you play as a waiter delivering food to table.

Made entirely from scratch over three days for the 49th Ludum Dare game jam with my friend Jonathan, this game was a lot of fun to make and is even more fun to play. Using the arrow keys, you must navigate through levels in as short a time as possible and by making as little damage as possible. The only catch is the waiter you control is a little unstable and will easily fall over if you lean too much in a certain direction!

Other game ideas we had for the 'Unstable' theme were:
- A potion making game. You play by brewing potions by interacting with a GUI and following a set of instructions. How well you brew the potion determins if the potion is stable or not.
- Indiana Ball. You take on the role of a boulder trap like in Raiders of the Lost Ark, rolling the ball around a labyrinthian abandoned temple by tilting it around it like a [Labyrinth marble game][Marblegame]. Your aim is defend the temple's treasures from a wave of pesky adventurers by squashing them all!

I'll write these down for future reference, I think these would be fun to make at some point!
