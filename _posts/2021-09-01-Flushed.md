Having not used Unity since my third year [undergraduate project][proteinVisualiserLink], I was no longer familiar with some of its features. I developed Flushed! over the course of a small week with the aim of rediscovering the Unity game engine and making a game to boot.\
\
I wanted to make a small game, typically something one would play on their phone for at most five minutes while sitting on the loo like Temple Run or Subway Surfers. The aim of the game is as follows: you play as an unfortunate rubber ducky who has been flushed down a toilet and have to go as far down the plumbing as possible whilst avoiding obstacles and collecting jewelery for your score. \
The gameplay elements were implemented quite quickly and I found myself spending a bit too much time browsing free assets online, cleaning them up for use and even creating some myself. \
\
I really enjoyed making this small game and it proved to be valuable preparation for making [Can't wait][CantWait].
