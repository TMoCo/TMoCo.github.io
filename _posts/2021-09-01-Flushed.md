*Flushed! main menu*

Having not touched Unity since my third year [undergraduate project][proteinVisualiserLink], I needed a refresher. I developed Flushed! over half a week with the aim of refamiliarising myself with the Unity game engine.\
\
I wanted to make a game one would typically play on their phone for about five minutes while sitting on the toilet (hence the theme) like Temple Run or Subway Surfers.\
The aim of the game is as follows: you play as an unfortunate rubber ducky that has just been flushed away and have to go as far down the plumbing as you can whilst avoiding obstacles and collecting jewelery for your score.\

The gameplay elements were implemented quite quickly and I found myself spending a bit too much time browsing free assets online, cleaning them up for use and even creating some myself.\
I really enjoyed making this small game and it proved to be valuable preparation for making [Can't wait][CantWait].
