*Ubiquitin protein*

The aim of this project was to explore the use of game technologies to aid in a field of research, in this case the study of molecules in biochemsitry.\
Made in Unity, this application provides some of the core functionalities expected from standard molecular visualisers such as VMD:
- Load protein data from .pdb files (from the [Protein Data Bank][pdb]) and .dssp files (protein secondary structure data)
- Provide a selection of representations for viewing loaded molecules
- The ability to select specific atoms/amino acids/primary and secondary structures, and choose different representations for them\

Using Unity meant I could spend more time researching core biochemestry concepts and doing background reading compared to other engines which are arguably harder to assimilate for beginners.

I really enjoyed working on this project, getting to learn about a completely new subject was stimulating, especially such a vast one. As a result, I gained confidence in my skills as an independent researcher, developer and project manager.

> Trivia: The creators of X-ray crystallography (the method used to determine the structure of molecules) were scientists at Leeds!
