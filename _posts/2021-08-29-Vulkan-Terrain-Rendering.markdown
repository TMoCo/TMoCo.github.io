*Flight simulator to navigate around the terrain*

The goal of this coursework was to explore terrain rendering though the Vulkan API. The terrain is generated by reading values from a grayscale height map and using them as the Y value of vertices in an XZ plane.\
Interestingly, __gl_VertexIndex__ can be used to bypass the need to send vertex data to the GPU by invoking __VkCmdDraw__ or __VkCmdDrawIndexed__ without binding a vertex buffer.
{% highlight glsl %}
int id = gl_VertexIndex;
int row = id / mapSize;
int col = id / mapSize;
vec2 uv = vec2(row / (float)mapSize, col / (float)mapSize);
vec3 position = vec3(
     row - mapSize / 2.0f,
     texture(heightSampler, uv),
     col - mapSize / 2.0f);
{% endhighlight %}

A typical optimisation for terrain rendering is to apply binning to the terrain, i.e separating sections of it into bins, and only rendering those visible. I opted to divide the terrain into even sections and use the dot product of the bin's midpoint with the camera's view direction.\

This was sufficient for the coursework but is not ideal (enter kd-trees, LOD tesselation on the GPU...). I hope to revisit this project and explore more terrain rendering techniques with my improved C++ and Vulkan knowledge.
