My name is Thomas Moreno Cooper, and I'm a 22 year-old graduate from the University of Leeds. I completed my Meng in [Computer Science with High Performance Graphics and Games Engineering][HPG] in the summer of 2021, graduating with first class honours.

I grew up in the south of France near Marseille, completing an [OIB Baccalaureat][OIB] and majoring in mathematics. Prior to my further studies in Leeds, I had never done any programming at all and very nearly went to Paris to study History. My strenght in Mathematics and my love for computer games were the motivations behind choosing to study computer science at Leeds. Nevertheless this was a tough decision, and for a long time I was unsure if I had made the right career choice.

As my studies progressed, so did my interest in them grow; so much so that I ended up achieving higher results in my last two years than in my first two. I discovered my love for computer graphics and game technologies, realising that through them I could combine software engineering with the subjects I enjoyed so much in high school like physics and even the arts. 

Having happily graduated and after a short break working on personal projects, I'm now actively lookin for an entry-level role in the video games industry. 
In my free time, I develop applications experimenting with new graphics techniques. I'm always thinking about ways to improve my previous work, reading about techniques I didn't have the time to stduy in detail at university, tinkering with my setup, learning new things about my favorite programming languages as well as new ones.
