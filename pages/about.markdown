So you want to know about me? How flattering! Well here's a little synopsis.

I grew up in the south of France near Marseille and spent the first 18 years of my life there. After obtaining an [OIB Baccalaureat][oib] in 2017, I moved to Leeds to study for an MEng in [Computer Science with High Performance Graphics and Games Engineering][hpg], which I completed in the summer of 2021 with first class honours.

Prior to my further studies in Leeds, I had never done any programming at all. My favorite subject at school had always been History, so much so that I received an offer to study it at the Sorbonne in Paris. However, my strengths in Physics and Mathematics and my interest in computer graphics, the creation of virtual worlds, the likes of which I had explored so often when playing computer games, were the driving motivators for eventually choosing to study Computer Science.

It turns out that committing to a new subject at university is really tough, despite my preconceptions about my academic skills, and I struggled to adjust to a student lifestyle which took a heavy toll on my confidence and my mental health.

As my studies progressed, my interest in Computer Science grew and thanks to the support of my dear friends and wonderful family I was much happier and more successful in my last two years than in my first two at university. I discovered that I love making software that lets people share experiences with others, interact with exciting content and broadening their horizons by learning new things.

After graduating I went on a sabbatical back in Marseille, enjoying the sunshine, the wonderful landscapes, urban and natural, and working on personal projects to hone my programming skills, which were instrumental when applying for jobs. This website is one of the many fruits of this labour, serving as a showcase for all my projects, and not necesarily software related ones!
