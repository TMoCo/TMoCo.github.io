For my master's project, I led a 5-person team to develop a game engine in C++. This culminated in the Raven Engine, for which my team won 1st prize at the [Games Republic 2021 Student Showcase][student_showcase] in the Games Technology category.\
The Raven engine has many desirable features such as a scene editor, an entity component system, physics, high end graphics (PBR, IBL), animations and a resource manager. My main contributions to the engine were the creation of the resource manager, making sure to keep the memory consumption of assets as small as possible, and the integration of a 3D physics library for use in the engine.

Being team leader, I had responsilities beyond simply contributing to the writing of the engine such as managing workloads and deadlines, organising my team's comunications and providing support to my team mates; all of which was impacted by the Covid-19 pandemic.\
Nevertheless, my team managed to rise to the challenge and succesfully created a functional and complex piece of software of which I am very proud.
