Can't wait is a physics based game made with the Unity game engine where you play as a waiter delivering food to tables.

Made entirely from scratch (except for the royalty-free music and sound effects) over three days for the 49th Ludum Dare game jam with my friend Jonathan, this game was a lot of fun to make and is even more fun to play. Using the arrow keys, you must navigate through levels in as short a time as possible and by knocking as few objects and people over as possible. The only catch is the waiter you control is a little unstable and will easily trip if you lean too much in a certain direction!

You can view the submission [here][ld49] and download the game [here][game].

Other game ideas we had for the 'Unstable' theme were:
- A potion making game. Similar to Cooking Mama, the aim is to brew potions by interacting with a GUI and following a set of instructions. How well you brew the potion determins if the potion is stable or not.
- Indiana Ball. You take on the role of a boulder trap like in Raiders of the Lost Ark, rolling the ball around a labyrinthian abandoned temple by tilting it around like a [Labyrinth marble game][Marblegame]. Your aim is defend the temple's treasures from a wave of pesky adventurers by squashing them all!

I'll write these down for future reference, I think these would be fun to make at some point!
