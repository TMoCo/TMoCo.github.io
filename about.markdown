My name is Thomas Moreno Cooper, and I'm a 22 year-old graduate from the University of Leeds. I completed my Meng in [Computer Science with High Performance Graphics and Games Engineering][HPG] in the summer of 2021, graduating with first class honours.

I grew up in France, completing an [OIB Baccalaureat][OIB] and majoring in mathematics. Prior to my further studies in Leeds, I had never done any programming and very nearly went to Paris to study History. The main reasons behind choosing to study computer science in Leeds were my strength in Mathematics and my love for computer games. I was originally unsure if I had made the right career choice and very unhappy during my first few years. I know now with hindsight that I made the right decision.

As my studies advanced, so did my interest in the subject I was studying (I ended up achieving higher results in my last two years than in my first two). I discovered my love for computer graphics and game technologies, areas of computer science that combine so many different subjects, from art to physics, which resonate with me and my education. Having happily graduated, I now find myself spending a lot of my free time developing applications and reading around the subjects I studied. I'm constantly thinking about ways to improve my previous work, tinkering with my setup, learning new things about my favorite programming languages and new ones, and taking a lot of pleasure doing so.
