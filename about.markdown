My name is Thomas Moreno Cooper, and I'm a 22 year-old graduate from the University of Leeds. I completed my Meng in [Computer Science with High Performance Graphics and Games Engineering][HPG] in the summer of 2021, graduating with honours.

I grew up in France, completing an [OIB Baccalaureat][OIB] and majoring in mathematics. Prior to my further studies in Leeds, I had never done any programming and very nearly went to Paris to study History. The main reasons behind choosing to study computer science in Leeds were my strength in Mathematics and my love for computer games.\
I was originally unsure if I had made the right career choice and very unhappy during my first few years. I know now with hindsight that I made the right decision.

As my studies advanced, so did my interest in the subject I was studying which crescendoed all the way up into my fourth year; I ended up achieving higher results in my final two years than in my first two.
Having happily graduated, I now find myself spending a lot of my free time developing applications, reading around the subjects I studied (computer graphics, games technologies and high performance) and now love.
I'm constantly thinking about ways to improve my previous endeavours, tinkering with my work setup, learning new things about my favorite programming languages as well as completely new ones, and taking a lot of pleasure doing so.
