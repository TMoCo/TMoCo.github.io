My name is Thomas Moreno Cooper, and I'm a 22 year-old graduate from the University of Leeds. I completed my MEng in [Computer Science with High Performance Graphics and Games Engineering][HPG] in the summer of 2021, graduating with first class honours.

I grew up in the south of France near Marseille, completing an [OIB Baccalaureat][OIB] and specialising in mathematics. Prior to my further studies in Leeds, I had never done any programming at all and very nearly went to Paris to study History. My strength in Mathematics and my love for computer games were the driving motivations behind choosing to study computer science at Leeds. Nevertheless this was a tough decision, as History has always been a favorite subject of mine and as much as I love Leeds, it can't compare to Paris.

As my studies progressed, my interest in Computer Science grew; I ended up achieving better marks in my last two years than in my first two. I discovered my love for computer graphics and game technologies, realising that through them I could combine software engineering with the subjects I enjoyed so much before university.

Having happily graduated and after a short break working on personal projects, I am now actively looking for a graduate programming role in the video games industry, preferably in computer graphics and rendering where my greatest interest lies and I can apply my specialised skillset.\\
In my free time, I create games and develop applications experimenting with new graphics techniques. I'm always thinking about ways to improve my previous work, reading about techniques I didn't have the time to study in detail at university, tinkering with my setup, and learning new things about my favorite programming languages as well as new ones.
